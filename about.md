My name is Avi Singh. I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by [Prof. Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/). I graduated from IIT-Kanpur in June 2016, with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. 

In Summer 2016, I was a research intern in the [Machine Learning and Perception Lab](https://mlp.ece.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech, and worked under [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/) and [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/).

In Summer 2015, I was a research intern in the [Robot Learning Lab](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, and worked under [Prof. Ashutosh Saxena](http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/asaxena/index.html) and [Ashesh Jain](http://www.asheshjain.org) on the [Brain4Cars](http://www.brain4cars.com) project.
